# Week 2: Java Strings and OOPS concepts

## 🗓 Day 4 – Object-oriented Programming Fundamental 
**Date: 26-Dec-2025**

Focused on strengthening **Object-oriented Programming Fundamental** by understanding and implementing Java Class and Object concepts while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:
  - Understanding classes and objects  
  - Creating and accessing object members  
  - Using constructors  
  - Method invocation through objects  

- Java Methods:
  - Defining and calling methods  
  - Passing parameters and returning values  
  - Method overloading  

- Java Class Design:
  - Designing clean and meaningful class structures  
  - Using multiple objects for a single class  

---

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Used variables for all fixed values, user inputs, and results  
- Implemented logic using methods instead of writing everything inside `main()`  
- Followed proper naming conventions for variables and methods  
- Used meaningful program and class names  

---

### Work Done:
- Completed **Object-oriented Programming Fundamental** programs  
- Inserted all programs into submission documents  
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub
