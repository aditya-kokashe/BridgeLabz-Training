# Week 3: Data Structures – Linked List Fundamentals

## 🗓 Day 5 – Linked List Implementation & Operations  
**Date: 02-Jan-2026**

Focused on strengthening **Linked List data structure fundamentals** by implementing node-based list structures and traversal operations while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:   
- Linked List Concepts:   
  - Understanding node structure  
  - Creating and linking nodes  
  - Traversing through linked lists  
- Linked List Operations:   
  - Insertion at beginning, end, and specific positions  
  - Deletion of nodes  
  - Searching elements in a linked list  

### Best Programming Practices Followed:   
- Designed small, focused, and reusable methods  
- Avoided hard-coding values  
- Followed proper indentation and readability standards  

### Work Done:
- Completed **Linked List implementation and operations** practice  
- Implemented multiple Linked List programs  
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub

## 🗓 Day 6 – Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing Functions  
**Date: 03-Jan-2026**

Focused on strengthening **core Data Structure concepts (Stack, Queue, HashMap, Hashing Functions)** by implementing fundamental operations and understanding hashing mechanisms while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:   
- Stack Concepts:   
  - Stack operations (push, pop, peek)  
  - Understanding LIFO principle  
  - Handling overflow and underflow conditions  
- Queue Concepts:   
  - Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)  
  - Understanding FIFO principle  
  - Implementing queue using arrays  
- HashMap & Hashing:   
  - Understanding key-value pair storage  
  - Hashing functions and collision handling  
  - Insertion, deletion, and searching operations  

### Best Programming Practices Followed:   
- Designed small, focused, and reusable methods  
- Used meaningful variable and method names  
- Followed proper indentation and readability standards  

### Work Done:
- Completed **Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing Functions** practice  
- Inserted all programs into submission documents  
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub
