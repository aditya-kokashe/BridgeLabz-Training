# Week 2: Java Strings and OOPS concepts

## 🗓 Day 4 – Object-oriented Programming Fundamental 
**Date: 26-Dec-2025**

Focused on strengthening **Object-oriented Programming Fundamental** by understanding and implementing Java Class and Object concepts while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:
  - Understanding classes and objects  
  - Creating and accessing object members  
  - Using constructors  
  - Method invocation through objects  

- Java Methods:
  - Defining and calling methods  
  - Passing parameters and returning values  
  - Method overloading  

- Java Class Design:
  - Designing clean and meaningful class structures  
  - Using multiple objects for a single class  

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Used variables for all fixed values, user inputs, and results  
- Implemented logic using methods instead of writing everything inside `main()`  
- Followed proper naming conventions for variables and methods  
- Used meaningful program and class names  

### Work Done:
- Completed **Object-oriented Programming Fundamental** programs  
- Inserted all programs into submission documents  
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub

### 📌 Key Takeaway:
Developed a solid understanding of Java OOPS fundamentals by applying classes, objects, constructors, and methods to design clean, modular, and reusable programs.

## 🗓 Day 5 – Java Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables  
**Date: 27-Dec-2025**

Focused on strengthening **Java Constructors and Instance vs Class Variables** by understanding object initialization, memory behavior of variables, and class design principles while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- Java Constructors:
  - Purpose and usage of constructors  
  - Default constructor  
  - Parameterized constructor  
  - Constructor overloading  
  - Use of `this` keyword
    
- Instance vs Class Variables:
  - Instance variables and their memory allocation  
  - Class (static) variables and shared memory behavior  
  - Difference between instance and static members
    
- Object Initialization:
  - Initializing objects using constructors  
  - Accessing variables and methods using objects  

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Used variables for all fixed values, user inputs, and results  
- Implemented logic using methods instead of writing everything inside `main()`  
- Followed proper naming conventions for variables and methods  
- Used meaningful program and class names  

### Work Done:
- Completed **Java Constructors & Instance vs Class Variables** programs  
- Inserted all programs into submission documents  
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub

### 📌 Key Takeaway:
Understood how constructors and static vs instance variables actually behave in memory and how they are used in real Java programs.

# Week 3: Java Keywords & Object Handling

## 🗓 Day 1 – this, static, final Keywords & instanceof Operator  
**Date: 29-Dec-2025**

Focused on strengthening **Java keyword concepts and object handling techniques** by understanding and implementing `this`, `static`, `final` keywords and the `instanceof` operator along with scenario-based programming while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:
- Java Keywords:
  - `this` keyword and its use cases  
  - `static` variables and methods  
  - `final` variables, methods, and classes  

- Object Handling:
  - Understanding the `instanceof` operator  
  - Checking object types at runtime  

- Scenario Based Logic:
  - Implementing real-world logic using OOPS concepts  
  - Applying conditions and validations  

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Used variables for all fixed values, user inputs, and results  
- Implemented logic using methods instead of writing everything inside `main()`  
- Followed proper naming conventions for variables and methods  
- Used meaningful program and class names  

### Work Done:
- Completed **this, static, final keywords & instanceof** programs  
- Implemented **5 scenario-based programming problems**  
- Inserted all programs into submission documents  
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub

### 📌 Key Takeaway:
Developed a clear understanding of how Java keywords control object behavior, memory usage, and type checking while applying them in real-world scenario-based programs.
