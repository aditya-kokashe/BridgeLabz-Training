## 🗓 Day 1 – Java Generics  
**Date: 15-Jan-2026**

Focused on strengthening **Java Generics concepts** by understanding type safety, reusable code design, and generic classes and methods while following professional coding standards.

### What I practiced today:   
- Java Generics Fundamentals:   
  - Understanding the need for Generics  
  - Type safety at compile time  
  - Avoiding ClassCastException  
- Generic Classes & Methods:   
  - Creating generic classes  
  - Defining generic methods  
  - Using type parameters effectively  

### Scenario Based Systems Implemented:
- HospitalQueue – Patient Sorting by Criticality   
- SmartShelf – Real-Time Book Arrangement
- ZipZipMart – Daily Sales Summary Report
- EventManager – Ticket Price Optimizer
- ExamCell – Student Rank Generator
